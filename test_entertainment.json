    "full_text": "After the mess, the mop-up.\n\nThat’s one way to understand Taylor Swift’s new album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” on which music’s biggest star offers up a dozen precision-cut pop songs just 18 months removed from last year’s sprawling and emotionally unstable “The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\nThat earlier LP, which contained 16 tracks before Swift expanded it with 15 more, was perhaps the most divisive of the singer’s two-decade-long career; it racked up bonkers sales and streaming numbers, of course — at this point, she’s truly too big to fail — but its mixed reception among tastemakers and even some fans seemed to rattle Swift, who for all her alertness to the brutality of being a woman in the public eye has become accustomed to a certain level of idolatry.\n\nShare via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied!\n\n\n\nSo here’s “Showgirl,” her 12th studio LP, for which she stepped away from her longtime creative partner Jack Antonoff to reteam with Max Martin and Shellback, the two hit-making Swedish producer-songwriters who helped her transition cleanly from country to pop in the mid-2010s with blockbuster albums like “Red” and “1989.” Swift has said she made the new album while roaming around Europe in the summer of 2024 on her record-obliterating Eras tour, which explains the title even as it begs all sorts of questions about her psychotic work ethic.\n\nAnd let’s be clear: These three can craft a hook as neatly and as skillfully — as deviously, really — as anyone in the business. In contrast with the bleary “Tortured Poets,” which yielded only one pop-radio monster in the Hot 100-topping “Fortnight,” “Showgirl” is likely to spin off several, not least the album’s lead single, “The Fate of Ophelia,” which rides an irresistible new wave groove that evokes the veteran hookmeisters of Eurythmics. (Look ’em up, kids.)\n\nAs a piece of psychological portraiture, though — the framework, for better or for worse, by which Swift has trained us to interpret her music — this collection of expertly tailored bops falls well short of its predecessor; “Showgirl” feels like a retreat from the vivid bloodletting of “Tortured Poets,” which captured a woman whose one-of-one success had emboldened her to speak certain toxic truths.\n\nIs that because she’s ended up in a healthy romantic relationship with Travis Kelce, the NFL star whom she’s engaged to marry? One hates to indulge hoary ideas about happiness being bad for songwriters. Yet there’s no denying that Swift’s lyrics about love here lack the kind of depth she’s mined in tunes thought to have been inspired by the dastardly likes of John Mayer and Matty Healy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot,” she sings, somehow, in the electro-trappy “Wish List,” which recounts all the hoping and dreaming she did before she finally met Mr. Right; “Wood,” a kind of kiddie-disco number that sounds like Martin was aiming it for the “Trolls” movie franchise, exults in the erotic thrill of a guy brandishing “new heights of manhood.” (In case you missed it, I’m sorry to say that’s a reference to Kelce’s podcast, on which Swift recently appeared and dropped a bar about her fiancé — “He may not have read ‘Hamlet,’ but I explained it to him” — that she really should have saved for “The Fate of Ophelia.”)\n\nElsewhere, she makes familiar complaints about the punishing experience of celebrity, as in “Elizabeth Taylor” — “Oftentimes, it doesn’t feel so glamorous to be me” — and “Cancelled!,” which feels like a goth-Nirvana redo of “Look What You Made Me Do,” from 2017’s genuinely startling “Reputation.”\n\nMusic What perfection means to Lorde As she takes her latest album on the road, the New Zealand-born pop star discusses her desire to be ‘radically transparent.’\n\nAnd then there’s the acidic “Actually Romantic,” which seems to be a response to Charli XCX’s “Sympathy Is a Knife,” in which Charli expressed her anxieties about being compared to Taylor in a zero-sum pop scene; Swift gets off some funny lines about chihuahuas and cocaine but totally forgoes the sense of empathy that made her such an icon to every pop songwriter who’s come up behind her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat’s good on “Showgirl”? “Opalite” is a gorgeous soft-rock tune about overcoming old instincts — “I had a bad habit of missing lovers past / My brother used to call it ‘eating out of the trash’” — while “Ruin the Friendship” looks back at a shoulda-woulda high-school dalliance with the pin-prick precision that Swift has always mustered when writing about her adolescence. Both songs ride coolly laidback Fleetwood Mac-style grooves that feel new for Martin and Shellback, who throughout the album rely more than you’d expect on live instrumentation. (Hang with “Wish List,” if you can, for a killer bass line that shows up in the second verse.)\n\nSwift sings more than once about legacy and inheritance on this album: “Father Figure,” which interpolates George Michael’s late-’80s classic of the same name, is narrated by a mentor who’s betrayed by his protégé; the Broadway-ish title track, which closes the album with a feature from Sabrina Carpenter, tracks the aspirations of a showbiz hopeful from fresh-faced naivete to all-knowing cynicism.\n\nMaybe those songs are Swift’s way of telling us that she knows “The Life of a Showgirl” isn’t as sharp as it could’ve been. We’ll see if it’s as tidy as it needed to be.",

    "full_text": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are going for a divorce. The Oscar-winning actor filed for a divorce from the musician after 19 years of togetherness. As per a source, she feared the separation news going public. However, Kidman ended up dealing with things well.\n\nNicole Kidman is ‘surprisingly level-headed and calm’ after Keith Urban breakup, source claims\n\nAs per PEOPLE, Nicole Kidman is dealing with her divorce and breakup from Keith Urban well. A source close to the family told the outlet that the 58-year-old has “been stressed because she knew the separation would eventually become public and she was dreading it.” However, the “Babygirl” actor is “surprisingly level-headed and calm.” The source further added, “Now that it’s out she’s just focused on what’s ahead and her girls.”\n\nThe reason behind Kidman and Urban’s split is not confirmed yet. However, the mother of four was reportedly skeptical about ending the relationship and wanted to save it. Additionally, she knew about the third person coming between them. One close source told Rob Shuter that Kidman “wanted to fight for them, but Keith had already checked out — and she knew why.” The source also explained, “It wasn’t about distance, schedules, or bad habits. It was about another woman.” They continued, “And Nicole knows who she is.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdditionally, the musician’s friends reportedly tried to protect him and cover for the mysterious woman. They attempted to downplay the rumors and spread the idea that Urban and Kidman were “stronger than ever.” However, Kidman “wasn’t buying it.” Another insider mentioned that the actor is “not naïve. She heard the stories, she saw the signs. At some point, the truth becomes impossible to ignore.”\n\nThe pair reportedly quietly separated in June. While Kidman hoped counselling might sort out things for them, she could not take the betrayal. The source concluded, “She’s not going to live as anyone’s second choice.” Additionally, the outlet reported that Kidman has found an ally in Hugh Jackman’s ex-wife, Deborra-Lee Furness, while dealing with the split. An insider revealed, “Deb keeps telling Nicole, ‘You’ll survive this. You’re stronger than you think.”\n\nOriginally reported by Ritika Singh for RealityTea.\n\nThe post Nicole Kidman Handling Keith Urban Breakup ‘Surprisingly’ Well, Source Claims appeared first on Mandatory.",
